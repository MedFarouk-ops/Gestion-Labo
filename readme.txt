**Project Title:** Research Lab Management System

**Description:**
During the academic year 2021/2022, as part of the GI3 class at the National School of Engineers of Sfax, a web application was developed to facilitate the management of a research laboratory. The aim was to create a comprehensive platform that could streamline various activities within the laboratory, including managing members, publications, events, and tools developed by the researchers.

**Key Features:**

1. **Member Management:** The system allows the administration of member profiles within the laboratory. Each member, whether a student or a permanent research faculty, is identified by unique attributes such as their ID, name, address, institution, and areas of research interest.

2. **Publication Management:** Researchers can publish their work through the platform, including journal articles, book chapters, books, posters, etc. Publications can have multiple authors, all of whom are assumed to be members of the same laboratory.

3. **Tool Development and Sharing:** Researchers can develop tools and contribute them to the community as open-source resources. These tools can be accessed and downloaded by other members and visitors to the platform.

4. **Event Organization:** The system supports the organization and management of events within the laboratory. Members can view upcoming events and participate in their organization.

5. **Advanced Search:** Visitors can perform advanced searches on members and publications based on various criteria such as academic rank, institution, publication year, and type.

6. **Profile Management:** Each member has access to their profile, where they can update personal information, manage publications, tools, events, and supervise students under their guidance, whether in thesis or master's programs.

7. **Administrative Privileges:** An administrator role is provided with the capability to oversee and manage all aspects of the platform, including member profiles, publications, events, and tools.

**Architecture:**
The architecture adheres to the standards of Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for the research laboratory management system.
